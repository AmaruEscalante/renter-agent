        "text": "Was a tenant from Nov. 2023 - Nov. 2024 and sharing my experience. I spent a year at 246 Ritch Street in a 2nd floor studio apartment with a patio.\n\nTLDR: Building is decent, management behaves poorly at best.\n\nPros:\n\n- Units have large windows and great access to natural light.\n- The private patio (available on a few units) was spacious. It provided great access to light and fresh air.\n- Location is close to major Muni lines (the N and the T specifically) and numerous good restaurants.\n- Proximity to Oracle Park is good during the MLB season.\n- Location is generally quiet at night.\n\nCons:\n\n- Private patios on floor 2 sit directly facing the windows of another apartment building, meaning true privacy is impossible.\n- Transaction fees on ALL electronic payments (including ACH/eCheck and Debit Card!). This is an uncommon practice in 2025.\n- Utility fees are incredibly absorbent, often exceeding $200 - $300 for a month, which is far above average for similar size and location apartments.\n- Property management is incredibly shady and less than competent. When informing them of my intent to vacate the property, they quoted me false contract terms and made-up laws to compel me to stay. I had to threaten legal action/escalation before I was permitted to leave without penalty.\n- Property management withheld >90% of my $1000 security deposit, much of it for unspecific and unitemized expenses. This is a poor business practice and flatly illegal under California statute. My apartment was professionally cleaned and left in near perfect condition upon my departure.\n- At no point during my 12 month stay were any of the shared laundry facilities cleaned. One dryer was left in an un-repaired state for over 6 months without mention by the property management.\n\nWhile the location and building are decent, the often deceptive and always incompetent actions of the building management (AMC LLC) make me unable to recommend this apartment to anyone in good faith. Between overpriced utilities, unnecessary transaction fees, and security deposit withholding, plan for your annual costs at this apartment to be at least $3000 - $4000 above expectations.",
