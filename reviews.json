One tenant has been consistently intoxicated, leading to multiple disturbing incidents including physical altercations, false police reports and ongoing harassment. Despite several reports, management has done little to address the issue or protect other residents.\n\nSecurity overall is lacking. There have been thefts, and unfamiliar people frequently enter the building without question. It’s clear that resident safety and well-being are not treated as priorities. Future tenants should be aware that serious conflicts may be left unresolved, even when authorities are involved.",

        "text": "My review has changed from 4 to 1 over the past couple of years of living in this community. There are multiple issues here, including:\n\n1. Longer Entry/Exit Routes due to Continuous Construction: There is always some construction going on in this community. The elevators and stairs are frequently blocked, making it a longer route to enter or exit.\n\n2. Excessive Noise from Construction: On top of that, there is constant noise due to ongoing construction. For the entire year, something is always being worked on. If you plan to work from home, it’s nearly impossible. People in your meetings will hear the noise, and you’ll be forced to stay on mute to avoid disrupting the conversation.\n\n3. Frequent Water Shutoffs: Water shutoffs occur frequently in the building. They notify residents that the water supply will be stopped from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM via email, but it often doesn’t return until 4:00 PM. At least one water shutoff happens per month. Sometimes, they send emails stating the water will be shut off on a certain day, but nothing happens. Then, they send another email scheduling it for a different day, only for it to be postponed again—this cycle can repeat 4-5 times. As a result, you must plan your day around these notifications, only to find out later that the shutdown didn’t happen.\n\n4. Ventilation Issues: The building has ventilation problems. If someone cooks seafood in the middle of the night, your apartment will be filled with the smell because the rooftop ventilation fans are not functional. I have been complaining about this issue for the past five months, but it remains unresolved. I have to keep my apartment doors open in the freezing winter and turn on my noisy kitchen ventilation fan, making it impossible to sleep.\n\n5. Unresponsive Management: The management does not reply to emails. If you visit their office, a staff member will say that the person responsible is not available—only for that same person to suddenly emerge from their office. When you ask why they haven’t responded to emails for two weeks, they simply say they’ve been busy.\n\n6. Increasing Rent Charges: Every year, the rent increases, but the quality of services has only declined.\n\nI have stayed here for a long time because of the convenient commute to my office and gym, but now it’s becoming too much to tolerate. There is no peace, certainty, or safety here. Don't come here!",

But I had a frustrating experience with my apartment and want to share some advice to help others avoid the same issues.\n\nWhat Happened:\n1.\tLoud Vent Noise: After moving in, I discovered a vent running loudly from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., making it impossible to work. The leasing office suggested I “play music,” which was unhelpful. Listen to the video.\n2.\tUnexpected Fees: Expect charges $350+ in mandatory fees (e.g., package storage, internet, utilities) on top of rent.\n3.\tUnit Variability: Some units are well-renovated, while others have serious issues. Ground-floor units may have higher ceilings but risk pests near garages.\n4.\tForced Move: I was eventually offered a different unit but had to move again within a month, disrupting my work and leaving me exhausted.\n\nTips: Inspect Thoroughly: Check everything before and after moving in, document problems, and report them immediately.\n\nWhile I’m in a quieter unit now, the stress of moving twice and dealing with these issues was overwhelming. I hope this helps others avoid a similar experience. (Still exhausted even thinking about my double move). BTW I still stay here because other apartments nearby are wayyy more expensive 🙈",

        "text": "I visited this complex to tour the studio apartments since I know people who live here. My experience was pretty lackluster. The buildings are quite old, except for the newly constructed or renovated studios. The leasing agent, Pia, only allowed me to view three units, citing that others were under construction, even though they were listed as available. It felt like she wasn’t interested in spending much time with me, which was fine, but I even offered to self-tour, which wasn’t allowed since the units were new.\n\nA major inconvenience is the trash disposal process for these studios—you have to walk all the way across the garage, take an elevator up, and then find the trash room. It’s a hassle. Additionally, only the renovated units have a washer and dryer inside the unit. For other units, you have to use a shared laundry facility on the floor, which is not justifiable given the rent they charge.\n\nOn top of that, the utilities are quite costly. There’s a mandatory $60 internet fee for 1GB speed, with no option for a lower-speed plan. It feels like this is forced upon residents. The trash fee is around $100, which is very high, and there’s also a $9 Luxor package fee. It all feels like nickel-and-diming.\n\nAdditionally, for an ESA support animal, they require an interview with someone, which is something I’ve never encountered before. Overall, the added fees make it hard to justify renting here, especially when you can expect monthly utility costs for a single person to easily reach $300 or more. It’s disappointing compared to other buildings where you can provide a note from a provider for an ESA without all the extra hassle.\n\nThe only reason I see people renting here is that they don't realize there are better options out there, they like the location, or they’re simply used to living here.",

We’re actively modernizing the community, including adding in-unit washers and dryers, as part of our commitment to enhancing the resident experience. Pia aimed to provide a smooth tour by showing ready units, as some are still under construction. For safety and quality, self-tours are limited to specific units. Our amenities, such as high-speed internet and package services, are standard for communities of our size, and our fees are designed to align with local norms. We also use a third-party service for ESA verification to ensure transparency and compliance.\n\nWhile we understand our community may not be the perfect fit for everyone, many residents enjoy the improvements, amenities, and location we offer. Thank you again for visiting, and we wish you the best in finding the right home for you!",
